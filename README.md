# cypress-ajv-schema-validator

A Cypress plugin for API testing to validate the API response against Plain JSON schemas, Swagger documents, or OpenAPI documents using Ajv JSON Schema validator.

![Overview](images/overview.png)

For a detailed guide on how to use this plugin, check out my blog post, ["CYPRESS-AJV-SCHEMA-VALIDATOR Plugin: The Brave Vigilante for Your API Contracts,"](https://dev.to/sebastianclavijo/cypress-ajv-schema-validator-plugin-the-brave-vigilante-for-your-api-contracts-5cfe) on my Cypress blog. There you'll find comprehensive information about setting up and getting the most out of this plugin.

## Main Features

- Cypress command **`cy.validateSchema()`** and utility function **`validateSchema()`** to report JSON Schema validation errors in the response obtained from any network request with `cy.request()`.
  
- The command `cy.validateSchema()` is chainable and returns the original API response yielded.
  
- Schema is provided as a JSON object, that could come from a Cypress fixture.
  
- It uses the **Ajv JSON Schema Validator** as its core engine.
  
- Support schemas provided as **plain JSON schema**, **OpenAPI 3.0.1 schema document** and **Swagger 2.0 schema document**.
  
- Provides in the Cypress log a summary of the schema errors as well as a list of the individual errors in the schema validation.
  
- By clicking on the summary of schema errors in the Cypress log, the console will output:
  -  Number of schema errors.
  -  Full list of schema errors as provided by Ajv.
  -  A nested tree view of the validated data, clearly indicating the errors and where they occurred in an easy-to-understand format.

### About JSON Schemas and Ajv JSON Schema Validator

#### JSON Schema

JSON Schema is a hierarchical, declarative language that describes and validates JSON data.

#### OpenAPI 3.0.1 and Swagger 2.0 Schema Documents

The OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) are schema documents to describe your entire API (in JSON format or XML format). So a schema document will contain multiple schemas, one for each supported combination of **_Endpoint - Method - Expected Response Status_** (also called _path_) by that API.

#### Ajv JSON Schema Validator

AJV, or Another JSON Schema Validator, is a JavaScript library that validates data objects against a JSON Schema structure.

It was chosen as the core engine of the `cypress-ajv-schema-validator` plugin because of its versatility, speed, capabilities, continuous maintenance, and excellent documentation. For more information on Ajv, visit the [Ajv official website](https://ajv.js.org/).

Ajv supports validation of the following schema formats: **JSON Schema**, **OpenAPI 3.0.1** specification, and **Swagger 2.0** specification. However, Ajv needs to be provided with the specific schema to be validated for an endpoint, method, and expected response; it cannot process a full OpenAPI 3.0.1 or Swagger 2.0 schema document by itself.

The `cypress-ajv-schema-validator` plugin simplifies this by obtaining the correct schema definition for the endpoint you want to test. You just need to provide the full schema document (OpenAPI or Swagger) and the path to the schema definition of the service you want to validate for your API (_Endpoint - Method - Expected Response Status_).

> **Note:** The Ajv instance used in this plugin (`cypress-ajv-schema-validator`) is configured with the options `{ allErrors: true, strict: false }` to display all validation errors and disable strict mode.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D cypress-ajv-schema-validator
```

## Compatibility

- Cypress 12.0.0 or higher
- Ajv 8.16.0 or higher
- ajv-formats 3.0.1 or higher


## Configuration

Add the following lines either to your `cypress/support/commands.js` to include the custom command and function globally, or directly in the test file that will host the schema validation tests:

#### For `cy.validateSchema()` Custom Command

```js
import 'cypress-ajv-schema-validator';
```

#### For `validateSchema()` Function

```js
import validateSchema from 'cypress-ajv-schema-validator';
```


## API Reference

### Custom Commands

#### `cy.validateSchema(schema, path)`

Validates the response body against the provided schema.

##### Parameters

- `schema` (object): The schema to validate against. Supported formats are plain JSON schema, Swagger, and OpenAPI documents.
- `path` (object, optional): This second parameter only applies to Swagger or OpenAPI documents. 
  It represents the path to the schema definition in a Swagger or OpenAPI document and is determined by three properties:
  - `endpoint` (string, optional): The endpoint path.
  - `method` (string, optional): The HTTP method. Defaults to 'GET'.
  - `status` (integer, optional): The response status code. If not provided, defaults to 200.

##### Returns

- `Cypress.Chainable`: The response object wrapped in a Cypress.Chainable.

##### Throws

- `Error`: If any of the required parameters are missing or if the schema or schema definition is not found.

Example providing a Plain JSON schema:

```js
cy.request('GET', 'https://awesome.api.com/users/1')
  .validateSchema(schema);
```

Example providing an OpenAPI 3.0.1 or Swagger 2.0 schema documents and path to the schema definition:

```js
cy.request('GET', 'https://awesome.api.com/users/1')
  .validateSchema(schema, { endpoint: '/users/{id}', method: 'GET', status: 200 });
```

Using the path defined by `{ endpoint, method, status }`, the plugin will automatically take the schema `$ref` for that definition, find it in the `components` section, and use it in the schema validation.

### Functions

#### `validateSchema(data, schema, path)`

Validates the given data against the provided schema.

##### Parameters

- `data` (any): The data to be validated.
- `schema` (object): The schema to validate against.
- `path` (object, optional): The path object to the schema definition in a Swagger or OpenAPI document.
  - `endpoint` (string, optional): The endpoint path.
  - `method` (string, optional): The HTTP method. Defaults to 'GET'.
  - `status` (integer, optional): The response status code. Defaults to 200.

##### Returns

- `Array`: An array of validation errors, or null if the data is valid against the schema.

##### Throws

- `Error`: If any of the required parameters are missing or if the schema or schema definition is not found.

Example providing a Plain JSON schema:

```js
cy.request('GET', 'https://awesome.api.com/users/1').then(response => {
  const data = response.body
  const errors = validateSchema(data, schema);
  expect(errors).to.have.length(0); // Assertion to ensure no validation errors
});
```

Example providing an OpenAPI 3.0.1 or Swagger 2.0 schema documents and path to the schema definition:

```js
cy.request('GET', 'https://awesome.api.com/users/1').then(response => {
  const data = response.body
  const errors = validateSchema(data, schema, { endpoint: '/users/{id}', method: 'GET', status: 200 });
  expect(errors).to.have.length(0); // Assertion to ensure no validation errors
});
```


## Usage Examples

For detailed usage examples, check the document [USAGE-EXAMPLES.md](USAGE-EXAMPLES.md).

The examples included are for using:

- `cy.validateSchema()` command with a **Plain JSON schema**.
  
- `cy.validateSchema()` command with an **OpenAPI 3.0.1 schema** document.
  
- `cy.validateSchema()` command with a **Swagger 2.0 schema** document.

- `validateSchema()` function with an **OpenAPI 3.0.1 schema** document.
  
- `cy.validateSchema()` command in conjunction with **`cy.api()` from the `cypress-plugin-api` or `@bahmutov/cy-api` plugins**.


## Validation Results

Here are some screenshots of schema validation tests run in Cypress.

### Test Passed

When a test passes, the Cypress log will show the message: "‚úîÔ∏è **PASSED - THE RESPONSE BODY IS VALID AGAINST THE SCHEMA.**".

![Test Passed](images/pass1.png)

### Test Failed

When a test fails, the Cypress log will show the message: "‚ùå **FAILED - THE RESPONSE BODY IS NOT VALID AGAINST THE SCHEMA**"; indicating the total number of errors: _(Number of schema errors: N_).

Also, the Cypress log will show an entry for each of the individual schema validation errors as provided by Ajv. The errors that correspond to missing fields in the data validated are marked with the symbol üóëÔ∏è, and the rest of the errors with the symbol üëâ.

![Test Failed Overview](images/error11.png)

#### Detailed Error View in the Console

If you open the Console in the browser DevTools, and click on the summary line for the schema validation error in the Cypress log, the console will display detailed information about all the errors. This includes:

- The total number of errors
- The full list of errors as provided by the Ajv.
- A user-friendly view of the validated data, highlighting where each validation error occurred and the exact reason for the mismatch.

### Test Failed with More than 10 Errors

When there are more than 10 schema validation errors, the Cypress log will show only the first 10 and, at the end of the list, an additional line indicating "**...and _N_ more errors.**".

![Test Failed Many Errors](images/error21.png)

#### Detailed Error View in the Console

In this case, clicking on the summary line for the schema validation error in the Cypress log will also display: the total number of errors, the full list of errors as provided by Ajv, and the user-friendly view of the schema mismatches, making it easy to understand where the errors occurred.

![Error Details in Console](images/error22.png)

#### More Errors in the Console

When clicking on the "**...and N more errors.**" line in the Cypress log, the browser console will show additional details for the errors grouped under that entry as provided by Ajv.
